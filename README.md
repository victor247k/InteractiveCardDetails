## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

I have learned how to better set up the markup, how to style a bit better, what mistakes to naot make again, I alos got more comfortable using forms and inputs.

```html
<div class="inputNameContainer flex">
    <label for="inputName">CARDHOLDER NAME</label>
    <input id="inputName" type="text" placeholder="e.g. Jane Appleseed">
    <p class="errorMessage nameError"> </p>
</div>
```


### Continued development

I have to practice more doing responsive designs and also how to better do th layout, also I am not entirly happy with the js code, so I will have to improve in that rea aswell.
